# simple_portfolio_optimization
A simple portfolio optimization using the Gurobi optimization package in Python. This can, in theory, use any combination of stocks, so long as the .csv used for the returns is formatted correctly.
The code is created to find a minimum risk portfolio, as well as determine the efficient frontier for the given set of stocks and their respective returns. It also finds the maximum sharpe ratio portfolio along the efficient frontier of the given stocks.

There is also another set of data provided, to show how it can be used for
another given set of similarly formatted data, with no changed needed in the body
of the code.
